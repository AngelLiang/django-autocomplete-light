Ensure you have read the [FAQ](http://django-autocomplete-light.readthedocs.org/en/stable-2.x.x/faq.html).

Before opening an issue, ensure you have:

- clear steps to reproduce the bug,
- a fork of the repo with an additionnal app in test_project to reproduce your
  issue out-of-the-box,

Do **not** bother:

- pasting partial code in the issue text, ie. only forms and admin without
  models, etc, etc... Actually don't bother posting code at all: fork the repo,
  add example app, make a PR. We're not supporting anything that has not an
  example app.
- I'm most probably **NOT** going to create the example app for you and support
  the feature you need and do all the work by myself for free. So you need to:
  fork the repo, add your example app, ensure that it's easy to run, and make a
  PR. This app belongs to everybody who wants to "work it". If you don't want
  to help then don't bother, if you don't like the app don't use it.

I've been doing example apps for people for years, to help on stackoverflow, to
help with apps, etc, etc ... While I'm very efficient at it and probably made a
thousand of it, it takes time, and working on **actual , reproducible issues**
also takes time. Can't do both.

If you really don't want to contribute and want me to do all the work to solve
your problem with money, our hourly rate is $60.
